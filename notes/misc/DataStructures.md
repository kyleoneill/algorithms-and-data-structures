# Data Structures

## Foundational
- Array - Collection of a set size, can be randomly indexed
- Linked List - Collection of an unbounded size, cannot be
  randomly indexed and the chain must be traversed to access
  elements.

## Simple Collections
- Bag - A data structure that we can add to and iterate over, but
  we cannot remove from.
- Stack - An iterable data structure which is LIFO (last in,
  first out).
- Queue - An iterable data structure which is FIFO (first in,
  first out).
